## Jonathon Cronin with Iowa Solutions

Concept is to automate the ABBE Backup Monitoring.

Target language : Powershell

Environments are all windows Server computers - with the primary servers being those
that are windows 2008 and above


1. Have a central location (FTP if possible) that is updated from GITHUB Versions of the 
files that are being controlled through a central account.

2. That these files will deploy out to the servers throughout the system to allow for 
those files to be controlled centrally.

3. That these will be an email report compiled from these reports that is sent to me 
to check on the server status information across all of the backup information.


Time : 4 - 5 Hours Total ---> Will save 12 - 40 hours time in house without affecting
billable hours that we are able to make money from. 

Scalable meaning that we can in the future expand on ABBE situation with better monitoring
thereby decreasing the chance for a failure to occur in the system.
